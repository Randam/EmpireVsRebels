A Facebook Wargame for FB Live Video

A Facebook Live Video game should be very simple in nature. The idea is that the game environment itself is a video. The Facebook user can influence what is happening in the live video, by performing actions on the post. For example posting a comment, sharing, liking of tagging. These kinds of actions can be retrieved using the Facebook Graph API.

My game is about two groups of mechs: the Empire vs the Rebels (a cheeky homage to Star Wars). The mechs move and shoot by themselves, but you can join by commenting ’empire’ or ‘rebels’. I also wanted something to incentivize a share, so I opted for an ‘Air Strike’.

Every 10 minutes the side with the most kills wins.
